>> Project: Server and Client System on Raspberry Pi 4 <<

Platform: Raspberry Pi 4
Networking: UDP Socket Programming
Operating System: Custom Linux Build (Yocto Project)
Tools & Technologies:
Build System: Yocto Project, Bitbake
Meta-layers & Recipes: Custom meta-layer integration for building the environment

Achievements and Responsibilities:

>Development and Implementation:
Designed and developed a UDP-based communication system supporting up to 50 concurrent client connections to interact with a central server.
Utilized Yocto Project to create a customized Linux distribution, reducing boot time by 30% and improving system performance.
Created and maintained 8 custom meta-layers and bitbake recipes to streamline the build process and manage dependencies.

>Performance Optimization:
Achieved efficient data transfer with a latency of less than 10 ms per message on a local network.
Ensured reliable communication with a packet loss rate of less than 0.1% during extensive testing.

>System Integration:
Successfully integrated custom-built Linux images onto 10 Raspberry Pi 4 units, ensuring compatibility and stability.
Conducted extensive testing with over 1,000 test cases to verify system robustness and communication reliability under various network conditions.

>Documentation and Collaboration:
Documented the entire development process, including 200+ pages of setup instructions, build configurations, and usage guidelines.
Collaborated with a cross-functional team of 4 engineers to align system functionalities with project requirements and objectives.

>Technical Skills Utilized:
Programming Languages: C, C++
Networking: UDP protocol, socket programming
Build Systems: Yocto Project, Bitbake
Embedded Systems: Raspberry Pi 4, custom Linux builds
